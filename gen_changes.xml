		<title>MTS 2.0.Alpha.2</title>
		<revision rev="20">
			<change>The attribute "mode" in /scheme/colors/nicklist/item may now accept both mode prefixes and keywords, namely "any" and "*" to denote an entry matching any mode and "none" to denote an entry matching users with no mode.</change>
			<change>Updated the example in /scheme/configuration/options/group/option/item to exclude the depreciated "selected" attribute.</change>
			<change>Added the "hop" keyword in scheme/commands/command, this is referenced when a /hop command is issued.</change>
			<change>Added the "connect" keyword in scheme/commands/command, this is referenced when a connection to a server is initiated. It is not currently possible to halt default output for this command but it has been included to provide support for scripts using a non-standard means (eg. sockets) of connecting.</change>
			<change>Added the "connect" keyword in scheme/events/event, this is referenced when the "on connect" event is fired.</change>
			<change>Added the "disconnect" keyword in scheme/events/event, referenced when a connection to the server is terminated (the 'on disconnect' event is fired).</change>
			<change>Added the "logon" keyword in scheme/events/event, referenced when the "on logon" event is fired.</change>
			<change>Removed all DNS events from scheme/events/event and reorganized them under scheme/events/dns</change>
			<change>Added scheme/events/dns, ../dns/failed, ../dns/resolved, ../dns/resolved/header, ../dns/resolved/line, and ../dns/resolved/footer</change>
			<change>Modified the list of keywords for all instances of the "target" attribute.</change>
			<change>The "target" attribute is now capable of accepting multiple keywords in the form of a comma delimited list.</change>
			<change>Updated all files containing a listing for the "target" attribute's keywords, as well as modified examples to reflect and demonstrate the new keywords.</change>
			<change>The main index for the documentation is now valid XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0.</change>
			<change>Removed all MTS events from scheme/events/event and reorganized them under scheme/events/mts</change>
			<change>Added scheme/events/mts, ../mts/start, ../mts/load, and ../mts/unload</change>
			<change>Modified content.xsl and content.css to allow grouping by revision in gen_changes.xml (Change Log)</change>

		</revision>
		<revision rev="19">
			<change>Added "Namespaces" to the "Plugin Specifications" section to clarify the usage and purpose of namespaces (suggested by sax).</change>
			<change>Changed mts.css to a modified version created by thame^ which provides better support for Mozilla Firefox (thanks thame^).</change>
		</revision>
		<revision rev="18">
			<change>In spec_inheritance.xml - added links to general sites about inheritance, and made the first paragraph of "Basic Inheritance" a bit more informative (both of these are praetorian's suggestions).</change>
		</revision>
		<revision rev="17">
			<change>Added cypher's email to the MWG page.</change>
			<change>Made plugin specifications and theme specifications auto-expand in the table of contents (mts.html).</change>
			<change>Fixed a bad closing element, and a couple of name inconsistencies in the plug_code_data.xml. (thanks Sax)</change>
			<change>Fixed inconsistencies with examples in plug_xml.xml. The CDATA sections should be on a new line like most of the other examples throughout the documentation. Maybe we should decide on a standard format?</change>
			<change>Indentation of example in spec_format.xml was wrong. Also commented out a section about the 'mts' root element, which is not yet ready. Anyone?</change>
			<change>spec_schemes.xml is now relevant to its subject. I haven't been very creative about example names in this file, so if anyone has any suggestions, go ahead. And wording can also be a little off sometimes, as this is the first real version of this file. Please help improve it!</change>
			<change>Added spec_inheritance.xml - containing information about scheme inheritance. Again, the example names can be a bit more creative, and the wording can be way better. If you have any suggestions, tell me.</change>

			<change>Fixed a 1px display bug in the inline frame of the documentation by modifying mts.css. This change applies to both Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.</change>
